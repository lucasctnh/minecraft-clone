# Minecraft Clone: Game Dev Study 5
This is a very simple Minecraft clone project developed in Godot 4, following [LegionGames' tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAZ8D3rt5yU) as a starting point, but with additional features I came up with. The goal of this project was to learn the basics of the engine.
